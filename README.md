Steps to consider in order to refactor useRequest & useResponse

1. Refactor the code:
   1. Use early returns to reduce nested blocks
   2. Split the code to smaller functions
   3. Use Axios HTTP Interceptor for some parts
2. Use types exported from Axios
3. Write own types for what's not exported by Axios
